1. For Asynchronous Replication:
	○ Set Up Replication:
		1. Configure replication between the source and destination arrays using Pure1 or the FlashArray GUI.
		2. Ensure that replication policies and schedules are set up correctly.
	○ Start Replication:
		1. Begin the replication process, monitoring the progress through the GUI or CLI.
		2. Wait for the initial data synchronization to complete.


Connect Array from source to cluster:
Settings --> Connected arrays (Required connection key of another pure storage array)

Connection Key


	1. Login Source Array
	Storage -----> Array Tab -------> Array connections + Connect array 
	
	Connect Array:
	
	
	
	Management Address: https://Flasharray.pure.local
	Type: Async Replication
	Connection Key: (Target cluster + Storage + Array Tab click + symbol select Get connection Key-----> Copy the connection key and paste in the source cluster
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Replication Transport: Ethernet IP
	Replication address: Auto-discovered unless using NAT 
	
	
	Click on Connect
	
	Go with 2 cluster
	Refresh application.
	
	
	
	See Array connected.
	
	
	PODS:
	
	Create POD
	
	Storage ----------> PODs----------> Click + symbol and Create
	
	
	
	
	Enter POD Name and click Create.
	
	Once Create POD -------> Open the POD ---------> Add volumes
	
	
	POD Replica Link:
	
	 Storage ----------> PODs----------> Click + symbol and Create POD Replica Links
	
	
	
	Local POD Name: it takes POD Name automatically if multiple we need to select
	Remote Array: Select from DROP down
	Remote POD Name: Click on the new remote POD from the source cluster if you already have the target POD please select
	
	Click on Create.
	
	Go to the target cluster
	Protection----> Active DR tab --------> We see replicating source
	
	
	
	
	Check volumes and connect the volume to the host.
	
	
	
	To Map the iSCSI connection in Pure:
	
	Copy the server IQN and create a connection
	Health------> Connection-------> Click + Symbol ------> Enter a group name and add the IQN
	
	Open iSCSI initiator in the server and connect the pure array under the target with the name
