For migrating data to a Pure Storage array, I would start by assessing the current storage environment and planning the migration to minimize downtime and risk. Using Pure’s migration tools like Pure’s Storage Migration Service, I’d create a detailed plan that includes mapping source to target volumes, scheduling migration windows, and performing a test migration to validate the process. During the actual migration, I’d monitor progress closely and be prepared to troubleshoot any issues that arise, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal impact on users.
